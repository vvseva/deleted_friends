# deleted_friends
Shiny apps to understand the Facebook removed friends.

We are asking participants to export some of their data from Facebook and answer a set of questions about their deleted and removed friends.
We generate surveys on-the-go to focus participants' attention on specific people, whom they have removed, instead of hypothetical situations. 

Would it be better to launch it directly on facebook? 
Sure, but I don't have access to the field
